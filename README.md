### Project Motivation
My objective for this project is to evaluate if investing in Seattle Airbnb is worth it or not,so the three business questions that I would like to answer are:
1. Do investing airbnb in Seattle worth it nowadays?
2. What property and neighborhood are worth investing in?
3. What are the features or things that people care about the most if I own a property in Seattle?
